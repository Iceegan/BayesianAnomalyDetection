# BayesianAnomalyDetection
Using PyMC3 and Bayesian Inference to Detect anomalies in electrical grids.

There are several Jupyter notebooks available in this repository:

- `Bayesian Anomaly Detection.ipynb`
  - Contains a the first analysis used with a univariate autoregressive model for predicting grid operation. The prediction is combined with a p = 0.05 hypothesis test to determine if an observed signal is anomalous. 
  - The data for this notebook can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TrCfPnLnR_jvMMvg2MUJNI27_QwoY6ql).
